This project is for my personal use, aimed at tracking financial expenses and comparing prices in
different stores for statistical purposes. I developed this application for myself to monitor my
financial outgoings. It's not intended as a commercial business solution but rather to demonstrate
my Android platform development skills.

I organized the architecture of this project in such a way: one screen (Fragment) is one gradle
module. Based on logic, each screen will act as a separate feature. I understand this may seem like
over-engineering, but this division is necessary for my small project to demonstrate the ability to
organize a multi-module architecture.

Regarding the architecture, here's the tech stack used:

- mvvm
- di/dagger dependencies
- gradle multimodal project
- single activity

Here is the technology stack used:

- jetpack compose with fragments
